			<h1>CSC Advising - Class of 2029</h1>

			<p> Congratulations, first-year advisees! You’re nearly through your first semester at Villanova. It's time for your Spring 2026 registration. 
				<!--Course registration time for Spring 2025 is almost here! -->Your individual registration time is listed in your <a href="https://mynova.villanova.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myNova</a> student account (under "My Schedule and Registration").
			</p>

			<p>
				Your advising team this semester includes Dr. Nathaniel Chodosh, Dr. Mirela Damian, Dr. Justin DeBenedetto, and Dr. Ebel Nwafor. Faculty advisors work in teams to ensure that students always have access to an advisor, even when one member is unavailable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Please sign up to meet with one of your advisors to discuss your course selection and obtain your registration PIN. Before your meeting, review the <a href="https://banssb9.villanova.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/termSelection?mode=search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master Schedule of Classes</a> or use the Nova Schedule Builder in <a href="https://mynova.villanova.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myNova</a>, and bring a draft of your proposed schedule to the meeting.
